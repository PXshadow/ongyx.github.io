title: Kite

The moment the kite
Broke free from its string
It took to the skies
A black dot without meaning

Yet it took with it
Fragments of childhood dreams
The innocence, the memories
That seemed to fill reams

A profound joy was scattered
While the kite continued flight
Among the stars, nothing else mattered
As it stole away into the night

(Inspired by the last four lines of [风筝](https://www.cpcll.sg/xinkongxia/fengzheng).)
