title: Childhood, without worries
---

When we were young and little
Like a dandalion when brushed
We seemed vulnerable and brittle
Coming apart at a moment's touch

The will not to falter, and our determination
Got us through the night
Despite our trepidation
And not without a fight

The light at the end of the tunnel
Finally shone upon us
Perserverence throughout the muddles
And out tumultuous past

(Inspired by the last four lines of the first paragraph of [无忧的童年](https://www.cpcll.sg/xinkongxia/wuyoudetongnian).)
