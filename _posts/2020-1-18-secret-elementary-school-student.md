Jolted awake from dream, I was elementary school student\
Breathing and living sustained through hirigana\
Perfect scores unattainable unless you concentrate\
Only on here and now

I locked my\
emotions\
All of them\
In the deep abyss of my backpack

(Chorus)\
I slice off your voice, your voice\
So I can use it myself\
Searching for love, another world I had no idea of\
I listen to your voice, your voice\
Tracing lines back into my heart\
Barely understanding words, the deeper meanings I should know

Yep, I'm a secret elementary school student

Ask me what my dream was\
I'd say, elementary school student\
Use this voice to echo my song across the school\
Try as I might, loud as I can, but still can't reach you

I take all\
my homework\
Every last sheet\
Solve it with this voice I received, gift from you

(Chorus)

Growing up as an adult,\
misplacing everything,\
saying it'll all work out

Just a kid,\
don't know why I know so much,\
guess that we're not so different

This voice that you gifted to me\
Streching to infinity\
Yet you can't find me

I slice off your voice, your voice\
So I can use it myself\
Searching for love, another world I had no idea of\
I listen to your voice, your voice\
Drawing lines back into my heart\
Barely understanding words, repeating over and over like a broken record

Yep, I'm a secret elementary school student (x2)
