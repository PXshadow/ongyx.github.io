(WIP)

I can't be anyone other than me

Over and over, crying the nights away\
Living my life, continuing on, even today\
Hoping that tomorrow will bring a better start\
Hiding behind mirrors, my sword and shield

Reflected, my visage in the shards of glass\
Heart breaking, threatening to tear me apart\
Closed my eyes, drowning in a fitful sleep\
Deluding myself that tomorrow won't be that bad

I can't be anyone other than me\
It should be obvious, but they all fail to see\
Arranging feelings that I refuse to acknowledge\
Is it okay to yearn for a normal life?
