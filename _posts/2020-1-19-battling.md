Colliding like worlds, smelling an unintentional battle\
A fleeting moment of touch, bold yet so familiar

In another world surrounding this world\
Push comes to shove, you shouldn't have riled me up\
Between us, I don't think anything will change

Do you know the things I know?

(Chorus)\
It's time to fight this battle! (x2)\
Cast your eyes to the horizon\
With willing fate, we'll reach the checkmate\
Focus your imagination, it's time to fight this battle\
Stay your ground, don't waver\
Someday, somehow, we'll win and checkmate

"Attack, so this game is not lost!"

Your destiny is not set in stone...

"Attack, so this game is not lost!" (x4)

(Chorus)

We're now in the endgame
Not long until we reach checkmate

Yeah, checkmate (x3)

Checkmate
