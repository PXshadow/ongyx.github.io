(Chorus)\
The train bridging the chasm between cities\
Seems to have departed faster than the night breeze\
Scattered carelessly, the words that I have lost\
Holding tight to what's left, not ever letting go

Every breath hurting, step by step, but I smile\
Faking its ok, trudging through this endless day\
Scattered carelessly, the words that I have lost\
It's fine, I'll just find a ride on the local train

Rejecting evening\
Tiring of all the invitations to boredom\
Sudden loneliness\
Won't risk the back alley, only me, myself and I

Listen, as the traffic crossing whispers to you 'wait for me'\
Look, as the street corner on duty stares back, only to restrain you

(Chorus)

(Chorus 2)\
Every dream hurting, night by night but I sleep\
Faking it's ok, dragging through this endless day\
Scattered carelessly, the words that I have lost\
It's fine, I'll just find a ride on the local train

In the evenings, rush hour the train station's crowded\
Packed like sardine cans\
Just for a moment\
I want to pause this, sharing this place with no-one else

Again, a school of children swims past\
Dragging you along, a torrent

Listen, as the ticket machine whispers to you 'wait for me'\
My hands, closed tight, occupied like fare gates\
Will only serve to hold you back

(Chorus 2)

The train bridging chasms\
Has already left for greener pastures\
The night breeze howls\
Called forth by the train, hold on, don't get blown away\
You can leave the words I scattered carelessly all alone, you know\
Entrust your heart, soul and mind all to this swaying train car

The train bridging the chasm between cities-

The train bridging the chasm between cities\
Travelling to a place of far, distant goodbyes\
Scattered carelessly, the words that I have lost\
Holding tight to what's left, not ever letting go

Every breath hurting, step by step, but I smile\
Faking its ok, trudging through this endless day\
Scattered carelessly, the words that I have lost\
It's fine, I'll just take a trip on the local train
