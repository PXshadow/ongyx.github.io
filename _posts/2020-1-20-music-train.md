The feeling of being afraid\
It's normal, nothing to it\
Just gaze into the distance\
Walk before you run\
Little step by step, forward

Deep in the folds of my heart\
Your favourite train stands, idling\
Waiting, seem like forever\
As you can see\
Hearing it's jubilant whistle

Shake and dance your body away\
Soothe your nerves and your anxiety\
Mix and match, just keep moving\
I'll promise you'll be fine\
Anytime\
Little one\
Still growing up...

Tonight'll be music train\
Add a little party train\
Don't worry, I'll be there\
I'll come for you

Running to you, music train\
All for her, lucky train\
Laughing nights away\
Embracing one another\
Happy as we can be\
With her, one big family

The tears of joy flow freely\
A smile, spilling across your face\
Doesn't matter what season it is\
Call it a new wind blowing

You and I, two sides of the same coin\
Joy ad hesitation, entwined\
Sharing both, so close but yet so far\
As we run\
Across the rails\
Time laid for us\
Come now, let's go!

Tonight'll be music train\
Everyone's dancing train\
While we carve memories\
Hold tight, don't let go

Someday'll be birthday train\
Dazzling Christmas train\
As many times as you like\
To your desires\
For your happiness\
Watch and we'll carry on

Ride the music train\
Sing to the music train\
Dance to the music train\
Do do do do do do do do do

Ride the music train\
Sing to the music train\
Dance to the music train

She's always feeling sad\
How 'bout we go change that\
In a flash\
All we need\
Is a whistle!

Tonight'll be music train\
Add a little party train\
It's really important\
Because it's all for you!

To future freedom train\
A prayer for peaceful train\
Forever and ever\
That nothing will change

Sleep to the moonlight train\
Wake to the morning train\
I'll see you tomorrow\
Goodnight, my love\
I promise happiness\
Will come to you again

Ride the music train\
Sing to the music train\
Dance to the music train\
Do do do do do do do do do

Ride the music train\
Sing to the music train\
Dance to the music train
